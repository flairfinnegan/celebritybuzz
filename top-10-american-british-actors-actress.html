  <p><a style="color:#0000FF; font-size:1.3em;">Here Are The List Of Top 10 American-British Actors and Actresses </a><a style="color:black;  font-size:1.3em;"> </a></p>
  <p><a style="color:#0000FF; font-size:1.3em;"></a><a style="color:black;  font-size:1.3em;">An American accent is almost universally known and easily recognized since the majority of the world's influencers and celebrities are either from the United States or reside there. It's impossible to miss a thorough Boston accent or the thick New Jersey dialect like what is heard in The Sopranos. Another accent that sticks out like a sore thumb is a proper English accent, such as that of Michael Caine who played Nigel Powers in Austin Powers Goldmember. But not all British actors/actresses can be easily spotted. Some have adopted the American dialect exceptionally well. We'll take a look at the top ten British-American celebrities in Hollywood. Here they are <br><br>
  <strong>1. Idris Elba</strong> Hailing from the London Borough of Hackey in the United Kingdom, born in 1972, Idris Elba has proven himself as one o the elites of Hollywood with his vast range of acting roles in Hollywood. His ability to transition from his hometown in London and immerse himself in the American culture and lifestyle is clearly evident on the screen. Idris has starred in a plethora of iconic movies alongside exceptional actors and celebrities, such as Beyonce Knowles in Obsessed; No Good Deed with Taraji P. Henson; Takers with Michael Ealy, Zoe Saldana, rapper T.I., Chris Brown, and the late Paul Walker; American Gangster with Denzel Washington, and The Avengers. His net worth is estimated at around $30 million, with his highest-grossing film being Avengers: Infinity War earning $662 million at the box office.

Her wonderful persona and skill set have brought her to the biggest stages in the movie industry. A versatile actress known for her passion and prowess in interpreting roles and helping to project message-filled content to inspire her audience across the globe.

  <br>
  <strong>4. Henry Cavill</strong> If you've heard of the name Henry Cavill, your brain will automatically connect him with the most modern depiction of DC Comic's Superman character. Something you may not know is that the Man of Steel was actually born in Saint Helier, Jersey on the English Channel. The British actor's net worth as of 2021 is estimated at $40 million and with his acting resume, it's easy to see why. Apart from starring in Man of Steel, Batman vs. Superman, and the Justice League saga, Cavill has also starred in the action-packed movie, Immortals (2011), The Man From U.N.C.L.E. (2015), Mission: Impossible - Fallout (2018), and a host of other hit movies. His most lucrative film to date was Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice which grossed $874 million in 2016.

  <strong>5. Chiwetel Ejiofor</strong> He's the man who brought you the doomsday action/thriller, 2012, Twelve Years A Slave, and most recently, Infinite in 2021. But Chiwetel Ejiofor, who portrays the life of an African-American so well on screen, is actually from Forest Gate, London. He received his theatrical training from the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art and was actually discovered by Steven Spielberg during his school training.

He's been featured in movies such as Four Brothers alongside Tyrese Gibson and Mark Wahlburg, American Gangster, The Boy Who Harnessed The Wind, Salt with Angelina Jolie, as well as The Lion King as Scar. The net worth for his roles in these iconic movies is $16 million and the highest-grossing film he has starred in to date is The Lion King, which amassed $1.657 billion.

  <br>
  <strong>6. Hugh Laurie</strong> For all the die-hard fans of the Medical drama, House, you probably know every episode and medical abnormality by heart, especially the show's elusive infectious disease specialist played by Hugh Laurie.

  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>8. Kelly Macdonald</strong> Kelly Macdonald, while not a largely celebrated name, has been around the way in the Hollywood industry and has quite an impressive resume to her name. The British actress, born in the city of Glasgow in Scotland, United Kingdom, has starred in enigmatic films, wearing the hats of both a British and an American actress, as many English celebrities do. A few of her most memorable films include Trainspotting, Intermission, Nanny McPhee, No Country for Old Men, Gosford Park, Harry Potter, and The Death Hallows - Part 2, and the Walt Disney Animation movie, Brave. Although in Kelly's words, she doesn't "get to play glamorous parts," that still doesn't stop her from having a net worth of $75 million, landing her at No. 1 on People With Money magazine as the highest-paid actress in 2021.

  <span>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>9. Jason Statham</strong> Whenever you combine the words action, packed, and Brit in one sentence, you'll more often than not be mentioning Jason Statham soon after. He was basically born for this role, being that there's an epic fighting scene in almost every movie he's been in. Born and raised in the town of Shirebrook in Derbyshire, England, Statham is one of the few English actors whose guttural street slang has actually complimented his roles and characters, allowing him to be one hundred percent authentic in all his roles despite being in Hollywood. Some of his highest-grossing films include The Fast and The Furious: Hobbs and Shaw which grossed $173.7 million, The Meg which did $530 million, The Fast and The Furious 7, and The Fate of the Furious which both grossed over $1 billion

  <span>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>10. Christian Bale</strong> It's a hard-enough pill to swallow knowing that Superman is played by an English character in Henry Cavill, but the same can be said for Batman. Christian Bale, who began playing his role as Batman in 2005 with Batman Begins. Born in Haverfordwest, United Kingdom, Bale took his acting career to America where his first major horror film, American Psycho, shocked the world in 2000. A few other pieces of Bale's work include Exodus, Terminator Salvation, Equilibrium, and the Batman franchises. Although Bale's movies have rarely seen a payday below $100 million, his most outstanding movies at the box office were The Dark Knight(2008) and The Dark Knight Rises (2012), which both raked in over $1 billion each.
